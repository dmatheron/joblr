        Your application text must be different for every application you make! Please avoid these copy/paste, recruiters are used to them, and you will probably give a bad image of your profile.
        <br/>Why don't you talk about your own experience, and give the recruiter something that really caracterize your personnality.
        <br/>You can tell a short story about a former professional or personal experience. You should use this anecdote to explain why your are the perfect candidate for this job.
        <br/>The recruiter has to be captivated by your letter, as he would be by reading a best seller!
        <br/>Then he will remind your profile, and you will probably make the difference!
